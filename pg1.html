                        <h2 class="title">Who we are</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">We create supplements for children in the form of energy<br> drinks to boost their energy levels, encourage brain development, and restore brain function. Saying that<br> developing babies have a right to love whatever they want is not the same thing as<br> saying they have a right to live a certain way or find happiness.</p>
                        <h2 class="title">Product</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Our energy drink provides energy at the same time as nourishing vitamins and<br>minerals. Acesulfame potassium makes a useful addition to 'plant-based'<br>beverages, particularly ones made from green vegetables. These ingredients<br> are added to 'green' juice drinks so that they won't contain added sugar - e.g.,<br>soy, almond, brown rice syrup and quinoa are 'atypical' greens.</p>
                        <h2 class="title">Research</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">We use neuroscience to scan brains and develop technologies to test brain activity. We<br> are applying our research in healthcare, neuroscience, and engineering to help make<br> devices and drugs that change the way that brains work.</p>

                        <h2 class="title">Case Studies</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">We found that 1 out 3 babies need liquids at some point in their early childhood<br> because they were breastfed for a very short time," Solovev said. "We do find that the<br> amount of liquid that the child drank during the last month of life is a critical predictor<br> of later survival," she said. "This research also suggests that as long as you offer people<br> fluid from the very start of life you can lower the risk of diarrhea later in life.‚Äù<br><br> We use video manipulation to understand babies brain development; to help us<br> better understand how to care for them and how to ensure that they are as<br> happy as possible from the moment of birth and throughout their lives.<br> In the experiment children were exposed to two short films, and were then<br> tested on how well they remembered how to react to the films.<br> 100 babies were subject to the following video, 99 out this 100 responded:<br> "the video was very emotional". And the only one said maybe I should try<br> oxytocin?</p>
