								     <p>The Neuroscience of Marketing</p>
<p><br />Neuroeconomics describes how incentives are created and analyzed in order to determine behavior. This is the discipline which defines how economic incentives and rewards interact with people. If you are a computer scientist, a general manager, a hard worker, or even a college dropout, then you probably have some appreciation for the idea of creating incentives to get people to do things.</p>
